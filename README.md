Objectives of this Uvicorn Server:

1. I basically want to make a simple AI Agent backend library that can be used to create AI Agents.
2. I want to better understand how to use FastAPI and Uvicorn with the use of logging, metrics, and tracing. I want to be able to use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the server.
3. I also want to learn how to use print statements to debug the server when using FastAPI with uvicorn
4. I also want to test out the dspy library to see how it works.
